I've been collecting parts to build a <del>budget</del> gaming desktop. Having not built one in 6 years, there's absolutely a lot to learn.

### Build to date:
* Sandybridge i5 2500K
* ASUS Z68-V
* Kingston Hyper-X DDR3 1333Mhz
* Antec NEO ECO 620W PSU
* Samsung Blu-ray player
* Antec Three Hundred Two
* ASUS GTX-680 -- yeah yeah, I know. Battlefield 3 on Ultra at well over 60fps while peanut butter for months.
