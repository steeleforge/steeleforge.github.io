I've been collecting parts to build a budget desktop. Having not built one in 6 years, there's absolutely a lot to learn.

### Build to date:
* Sandybridge i5 2500K
* ASUS Z68-V
* Kingston Hyper-X DDR3 1333Mhz
* Antec NEO ECO 620W PSU
* Random Samsung DVD writer
* Random old case
* TBD: Video card! (waiting for Kepler impact)
