Howdy, I'm David Steele - a consultant, developer, designer, and professional shadowy figure. I primarily work from Chicagoland, but am a Michigander at heart. Frankly, my work has takes me all over the United States and abroad. Currently, I'm a happily employed <a href="#" rel="tooltip" title="(Read: digital mercenary)">consultant and software engineer</a> with a background in web development and design that spans over 9 years. Lastly: Go Blue!
