Howdy, I'm David Steele - a consultant, designer, and developer. I primarily work out of Chicago, IL but am a Michigander at heart. Currently, I'm a happily employed consultant and software engineer with a background in web design and development that spans over 9 years. I'm fueled by gratuitous amounts of coffee and a razor-sharp vision of what the Internet browsing experience  needs to become.

Resume TBD
